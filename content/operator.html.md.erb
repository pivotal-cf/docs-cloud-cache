This document describes how a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operator can install, configure, and maintain Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC).

## <a id="requirements"></a> Requirements for Pivotal Cloud Cache

#### Service Network

You must have access to a Service Network in order to install PCC. 

#### Minimum Version Requirements

PCC requires PCF v1.10 with PCF Elastic Runtime v1.10.3 or later or PCF v1.11 with PCF Elastic Runtime v1.11.0 or later.

#### Spring Session Data GemFire Apps

Apps using Spring Session Data GemFire 2.0.0.M1 do not run on PCC v1.2.0.
To run these apps on PCC v1.2.0, you must [upgrade to Spring Session Data GemFire 2.0.0.M2](./developer.html#spring_session_data_gemfire).

## <a id="install"></a> Installing and Configuring Pivotal Cloud Cache

Follow the steps below to install PCC on PCF:

1. Download the tile from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/cloud-cache).
1. Click **Import a Product** to import the tile into Ops Manager.
1. Click the **+** symbol next to the uploaded product description.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile.
1. Complete all the configuration steps in the [Configure Tile Properties](#settings-config) section below.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of the PCC tile.  

### <a id="settings-config"></a> Configure Tile Properties

Configure the sections listed on the left side of the page. 

![Tile Configuration Sections](tile-configuration-sections.png)

After you complete a section, a green check mark appears next to the section name.
Each section name must show this green check mark before you can complete your installation.

* [Assign AZs and Networks](#azs)
* [Settings](#settings)
* [Service Plans](#plan-config)
* [Dev Plans](#dev-plan)
* [Syslog](#syslog)
* [Errands](#errands)
* [Resource Config](#resource-config)
* [Stemcell](#stemcell)

####<a name='azs'></a> Assign Availability Zones and Networks

To select AZs and networks for VMs used by PCC, do the following:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the region that you want for singleton VMs.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
        <td>Select the AZ(s) you want to use for distributing other GemFire VMs.
            Pivotal recommends selecting all of them.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select your Elastic Runtime network.</td>
    <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
        <td>Select the network to be used for GemFire VMs.</td> 
  </table>

1. Click **Save**.

####<a name='settings'></a> Settings: Smoke Tests

The smoke-tests errand that runs after tile installation.
The errand verifies that your installation was successful.
By default, the `smoke-test` errand runs on the `system` org and the `p-cloudcache-smoke-test` space.

To select which plan you want to use for smoke tests, do the following:

1. Click **Settings**.

2. Select a plan to use when the `smoke-tests` errand runs.

     Ensure the selected plan is enabled and configured.
     For information about configuring plans, see [Configure Service Plans](#plan-config) below.
     If the selected plan is not enabled, the `smoke-tests` errand fails.

     Pivotal recommends that you use the smallest four-server plan for smoke tests.
     Because smoke tests create and later destroy this plan, using a very small plan reduces installation time.
     ![Configuring Smoke Tests Plan](select-smoke-test-plan.png)

3. Click **Save**.

#### Settings: Allow Outbound Internet Access

By default, outbound internet access is not allowed from service instances. 

If BOSH is configured to use an external blob store, you need allow outbound internet access from service instances.
Log forwarding and backups, which require external endpoints, might also require internet access.

To allow outbound internet access from service instance, do the following:

1. Click **Settings**.

2. Click **Allow outbound internet access from service instances (IaaS-dependent)**.

    ![Outbound Internet Access](allow-outbound-access.png)

3. Click **Save**.

####<a name='syslog'></a> Syslog

By default, syslog forwarding is not enabled in PCC.
However, PCC supports forwarding syslog to an external log management service (for example, Papertrail, Splunk, or your custom enterprise log sink).
The broker logs are useful for debugging problems creating, updating, and binding service instances.

To enable remote syslog for the service broker, do the following:

1. Click **Syslog**.
   ![Configuring Log Management Service](syslog-config.png)
2. Configure the fields on the **Syslog** pane as follows:
   <table>
    <tr><th>Field</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable Remote Syslog</strong></td>
        <td>Click to select this button.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong></strong>External Syslog Address</td>
        <td>Enter the address or host of the syslog server for sending logs, for example, `logs.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong></strong>External Syslog Port</td>
        <td>Enter the port of the syslog server for sending logs, for example,` 29279`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Enable TLS for Syslog</strong></td>
    <td>Known Issue: TLS must be enabled for syslog to work. It ensures secure log transmission through TLS.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Permitted Peer for TLS Communication. This is required if TLS is enabled.</strong></td>
        <td>If there are several peer servers that can respond to remote syslog connections, then
            provide a regex, such as `*.example.com`.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>CA Certificate for TLS Communication</td>
        <td>If the server certificate is not signed by a known authority, for example, an internal syslog server,
            provide the CA certificate of the log management service endpoint.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Send service instance logs to external</td>
        <td>By default, only the broker logs are forwarded to your configured log management service.
            If you want to forward server and locator logs from all service instances, select this.
            This lets you monitor the health of the clusters, although it generates a large volume of logs.<br><br>
            If you don't enable this, you get only the broker logs which include information about service instance creation, 
            but not about on-going cluster health.</td></tr>
  </table>

3. Click **Save**.

####<a name="plan-config"></a> Configure Service Plans

You can configure five individual plans for your developers. Select the **Plan 1** through **Plan 5** tabs to configure each of them.

![Configuring a Plan](configure-plan.png)

The **Plan Enabled** option is selected by default. If you do not want to add this plan to the CF service catalog, select **Plan Disabled**. You must enable at least one plan.

The **Plan Name** text field allows you to customize the name of the plan. This plan name is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Plan Description** text field allows you to supply a plan description. The description is displayed to developers when they view the service in the Marketplace.

The **Enable metrics for service instances** checkbox enables metrics for service instances created using the plan.
Once enabled, the metrics are sent to the Loggregator Firehose.

The **CF Service Access** drop-down menu gives you the option to display or not display the service plan in the Marketplace.
**Enable Service Access** displays the service plan the Marketplace.
**Disable Service Access** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace. If you choose this option, you cannot make the plan available at a later time. 
**Leave Service Access Unchanged** makes the plan unavailable in the Marketplace by default, but allows you to make it available at a later time.

The **Service Instance Quota** sets the maximum number of PCC clusters that can exist simultaneously.

When developers create or update a service instance, they can specify the number of servers in the cluster. The **Maximum servers per cluster** field allows operators to set an upper bound on the number of servers developers can request. If developers do not explicitly specify the number of servers in a service instance, a new cluster has the number of servers specified in the **Default Number of Servers** field.

The **Availability zones for service instances** setting determines which AZs are used for a particular cluster. The members of a cluster are distributed evenly across AZs.

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING!</strong> After you've selected AZs for your service network, you cannot add additional AZs; doing so causes existing service instances to lose data on update. </p>

The remaining fields control the VM type and persistent disk type for servers and locators. The total size of the cache is directly related to the number of servers and the amount of memory of the selected server VM type. We recommend the following configuration:

* For the **VM type for the Locator VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 1&nbsp;GB of RAM and 4&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the Locator VMs** field, select 10&nbsp;GB or higher.
* For the **VM type for the Server VMs** field, select a VM that has at least 4&nbsp;GB of RAM and 8&nbsp;GB of disk space.
* For the **Persistent disk type for the server VMs** field, select 10 GB or higher.

When you finish configuring the plan, click **Save** to save your configuration options.

####<a id='dev-plan'></a> Configure Dev Plans

A dev plan is a type of service plan. You can use a dev plan for minimal development and testing. The plan's locator and server are colocated on a single VM. 

<p class="note warning"><strong> WARNING</strong>: All of the dev plan data is stored on a single VM.
   When you update or upgrade your service instance, the data is wiped from the VM and the VM itself is recycled.
   Therefore, there is data loss when you perform an update or upgrade.</p>

The page for configuring a dev plan is similar to the page for configuring a [service plan](https://docs-pcf-staging.cfapps.io/p-cloud-cache/1-2/operator.html#plan-config). To configure the dev plan, input information in the fields and make selections from the options on the **Plan for test development** page. 

![Dev Plan Configuration Sections](dev-plan.png)

<a name='default-data-region'></a> **Default Data Region for the Dev Plan**

If you have enabled post-deploy scripts in your Ops Manager Director,
a data region called `example partition region` is created automatically with the dev plan.

Generating this region automatically lets developers begin testing without having to take extra steps
to create a space for testing.
For more information on data regions, see [Data Regions](https://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/basic_config/data_regions/chapter_overview.html) in the Pivotal GemFire documentation.

To confirm that post-deploy scripts are enabled, navigate to the **Director Config** pane of Ops Manger Director and
verify that **Enable Post Deploy Scripts** is selected.

![Enable post deploy scripts](ops-man-post-deploy.png)

####<a name='errands'></a> Errands

By default, post-deploy and pre-delete errands always run. 
Pivotal recommends keeping these defaults.
However, if necessary, you can change these defaults as follows.

For general information about errands in PCF, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html)

1. Click **Errands**.

2. Change the setting for the errands.
   
3. Click **Save**.

####<a name='stemcell'></a> Stemcell

Ensure you import the correct type of stemcell indicated on this tab.

You can download the latest available stemcells from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/stemcells/).


## <a id="monitoring"></a> Monitoring Pivotal Cloud Cache Service Instances

PCC clusters and brokers emit service metrics. 
You can use any tool that has a corresponding Cloud Foundry nozzle to read and monitor these metrics in real time.

The table below shows the metrics emitted through the CF Nozzle and their corresponding Key Performance Indicatior (KPI) guidelines.

### <a id="monitoring-prometheus"></a> Monitoring PCC Service Instances with Prometheus

Prometheus is one of various tools you can use to monitor services instances. It is a monitoring and alerting toolkit that allows for metric scraping.
You can use the [Firehose exporter](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose_exporter) to export all the metrics from the Firehose,
which you can then graph with [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) to monitor your PCC cluster.

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/prometheus-on-PCF) to deploy Prometheus alongside your PCF cluster.

Prometheus can be deployed on any IaaS.
You need to verify that the Firehose exporter job can talk to your UAA VM.
This might involve opening up firewall rules or enabling your VM to allow outgoing traffic.

![Grafana Example](grafana.png)

You can run queries on, and build a custom dashboard of, specific metrics that are important to you.

## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Cache

Follow the steps below to upgrade PCC:

1. Download the new version of the tile from the Pivotal Network.
1. Upload the product to Ops Manager.
1. Click **Add** next to the uploaded product.
1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile and review your configuration options.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

For PCC V1.2: If your developers use Spring Session Data GemFire for session state caching, ensure that they stop their apps before you upgrade PCC and that they then upgrade to Spring Session Data GemFire 2.0.0.M2, which is compatible with PCC v1.2. For information about how to upgrade, see [Upgrade Spring Session Data GemFire](./developer.html#spring_session_data_gemfire).

## <a id="update-plans"></a> Updating Pivotal Cloud Cache Plans

Follow the steps below to update plans in Ops Manager.

1. Click on the Cloud Cache tile.
1. Click on the plan you want to update under the **Information** section.
1. Edit the fields with the changes you want to make to the plan.
1. Click **Save** button on the bottom of the page.
1. Click on the **PCF Ops Manager** to navigate to the **Installation Dashboard**.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

Plan changes are not applied to existing services instances until you run the `upgrade-all-service-instances` BOSH errand. You must use the BOSH CLI to run this errand. Until you run this errand, developers cannot update service instances.

Changes to fields that can be overridden by optional parameters, for example  `num_servers` or `new_size_percentage`, change the default value of these instance properties, but do not affect existing service instances. 

If you change the allowed limits of an optional parameter, for example the maximum number of servers per cluster, existing service instances in violation of the new limits are not modified.

When existing instances are upgraded, all plan changes are applied to them.

## <a id="uninstall"></a> Uninstalling Pivotal Cloud Cache

To uninstall PCC, follow the steps from below from the **Installation Dashboard**:

1. Click the trash can icon in the bottom-right-hand corner of the tile.
1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a> Troubleshooting

###<a id='view-statistics'></a> View Statistics Files

You can visualize the performance of your cluster by downloading the statistics files from your servers. These files are located in the persistent store on each VM. To copy these files to your workstation, run one of the following commands:

  * **For Ops Manager v1.10 or earlier:**
    `bosh scp server/0:/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs /tmp`

  * **For Ops Manager v1.11 or later:**
    `bosh2 -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d DEPLOYMENT-NAME scp server/0:/var/vcap/store/gemfire-server/statistics.gfs /tmp`

See the Pivotal GemFire [Installing and Running VSD](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/gemfire/tools_modules/vsd/running_vsd.html) topic for information about loading the statistics files into Pivotal GemFire VSD.

###<a id='smoke-test-failures'></a> Smoke Test Failures

#### Error: "Creating p-cloudcache SERVICE-NAME failed"
The smoke tests could not create an instance of GemFire. To troubleshoot
why the deployment failed, use the cf CLI to create a new service instance using the same plan and download the logs of the service deployment from BOSH.

#### Error: "Deleting SERVICE-NAME failed"
The smoke test attempted to clean up a service instance it created and failed to delete the service using the `cf delete-service` command. To troubleshoot this issue, run BOSH `logs` to view the logs on the broker or the service instance to see why the deletion may have failed.

#### Error: Cannot connect to the cluster SERVICE-NAME
The smoke test was unable to connect to the cluster.

To troubleshoot the issue, review the logs of your load balancer, and
review the logs of your CF Router to ensure the route to your PCC
cluster is properly registered.

You also can create a service instance and try to connect to it using the
gfsh CLI. This requires creating a service key.

#### Error: "Could not perform create/put on Cloud Cache cluster"
The smoke test was unable to write data to the cluster. The user may not have
permissions to create a region or write data.

#### Error: "Could not retrieve value from Cloud Cache cluster"
The smoke test was unable to read back the data it wrote. Data loss can happen
if a cluster member improperly stops and starts again or if the member machine
crashes and is resurrected by BOSH. Run BOSH `logs` to view the logs on the
broker to see if there were any interruptions to the cluster by a service
update.

###<a id='general-connectivity'></a> General Connectivity
#### Client-to-Server Communication

PCC Clients communicate to PCC servers on port 40404 and with
locators on port 55221. Both of these ports must be reachable from the Elastic Runtime network to service the network.

#### Membership Port Range
PCC servers and locators communicate with each other using UDP and TCP. The current port range for this communication is `49152-65535`.

If you have a firewall between VMs, ensure this port range is open.
